# QuadRotor
_An unmanned auto-stabilizing aircraft_

## What is it?
The Quadrotor is a helicopter-like flying robot. It has the capacity of staying up in the air without the need for human control, and avoids obstacles and other barriers, too. It is made up of four brushless motors, forming pairs, that guarantee its autonomy.

## Who built it?
We are three students located in Brazil -- more specifically, in the city of Salvador, Bahia.
